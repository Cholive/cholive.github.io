It's one of America's most popular desserts and for good reason. Richly decadent, smooth and creamy, goes well with a myriad of fruits or syrups, and can turn a ho hum meal into an event, putting smiles on the faces of everyone. There are thousands of recipes, styles, varieties, ingredients and cooking methods but just the mere word conjures up visions of culinary bliss that few people can resist. It has been around for centuries in some variation. but somehow Americans seem to claim it as their own and have taken it to a higher level. We are a dessert-loving nation and cheesecake joins the ranks of the best.
