Where did the "hamburger" name come from? Some say it comes from the town of Hamburg Germany. Hamburg being a seaport town was where sailors brought back many items and ideas. The raw shredded beef was believed to be brought back after visits to the Baltic region of Russia. Some unknown German chef decided to cook the raw shredded beef, and this was the beginning of the hamburger.
