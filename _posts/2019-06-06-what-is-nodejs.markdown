What is Node.JS?

Node.JS or Node is built on Chrome V8 Javascript runtime environment for the development of faster, scalable and lighter mobile applications. It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it more efficient and lightweight, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications.Node.js uses an event loop within a single thread instead of multiple threads and can scale to millions of concurrent connections. The server can continue processing the incoming request, while I/O is processing, as Node is always asynchronous.
