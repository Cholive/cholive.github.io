    <p>Prior to coming to SAIT for Information Technology I was an Administrative Assistant. Some of the fields I have worked in are medical, oil & gas, IT and retail. When I worked as an Administrative Assistant in IT I supported two Associate Vice Presidents (AVP). During my time there I decided to look into SAITâ€™s IT program to see if it was at all possible for me to get educated in something I enjoyed doing and I read over all the majors and chose Software Developer because I had hope to become a Data Administrator. That all changed quickly once I experienced Web Development, right then I knew what my career path was supposed to be. </p>
    
    
    <p> Once I was done my first year as a Software Developer and dabbled in some other areas of IT which peaked my interest I decided to change my major to Web Developer. What I really enjoyed about website design was the fact that I could see the results in real time while learning the aspects of interface design on how to layout webpages to be user friendly. I believe I am on the right path to a great career in something I will enjoy doing in the years to come.</p>
